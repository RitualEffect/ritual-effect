            <h3>Who We Are...</h3>
            <p>Dublin band Ritual Effect fuses
                aspects of grunge and metal
                together with catchy riffs, fast paced
                songs, driving choruses and high
                energy shows.
                Since the band's inception in Late
                2017, they have have written a
                massive amount of songs, clocked
                up a hefty amount of gigs, and have
                released a <a href="music.html">full-length debut album</a>.</p>
            <div>
                <p>The band have appeared in
                    venues all over Ireland and have
                    become regulars on the roster in
                    Ireland's premier rock bar, Fibber
                    Magee's. They have been invited
                    back everywhere that they have
                    played, receiving enthusiastic
                    feedback from far and wide. Their
                    first assault on the live scene at
                    the King Kong club in Dublin
                    raised a full house of eyebrows,
                    and crowd enthusiasm and
                    interaction is peaking further with
                    every show.</p>

                <p>Paul is one of the greatest
                        drummers in Dublin's live scene. He brings
                        jazz, rock and metal elements to the
                        table, resulting in heavy, pulsating,

            <p>Ritual Effect are professional to work with, fun to hang out with and awesome to witness.</p>
            <p>2019 saw the band enter the studio for their first serious project: their debut album, <a href="music.html">"Fossils"</a>.</p>
            <p>This 15 track album is a heavy, melodic nod to their past and sets the pace for a high speed, full-on sonic assault on the future.
            <p>With their song bank close to full storage, a follow up mini-album is currently under construction and will hit the shelves in early-mid 2022.</p>
            <p>There is no limit to what this band is capable of in the rehearsal room, on stage or on tape.</p>
