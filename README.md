- #### Typography

    The main fonts used throughout the site are 'Tillana' and 'Skranji', with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case, for any reason, these fonts aren't being imported into the site correctly. Both were chosen for how they resemble and complement the lettering style of the Ritual Effect logo.

- #### Imagery

    The general colour scheme is complemented and enhanced by the use of both black-and-white and colour images. The large background and banner images were carefully selected to be striking and catch the user's attention. All imagery on the site was chosen to portray Ritual Effect's exuberant, energetic and flamboyant nature, both on and off stage.

### Existing Features

This site is responsive on all device sizes and includes interactive elements, detailed below.

- #### Navigation Bar

    - Featured on all pages across the site, the navigation bar includes the Logo and links to the Home page, Band page, Music page, Videos page, News/Events page, Gallery and Contact page. It is fixed to the top and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation. The logo also serves as a link to the Home page.

    - As a responsive design feature, the bar changes from an inline menu on larger screens to a drop-down, 'hamburger' style menu on small and medium sized screens, containing all the same links and features.

    - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 

    - The link to the page currently being displayed appears in uppercase with a double underline, allowing the user to tell at a glance where they are on the site.

## Testing
---

### Validator Testing

- #### HTML

    The official [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate every page of the site to ensure there were no syntax errors in the code. Among the errors returned were those from imported links copied and pasted from facebook and YouTube, such as embedded videos. These were ignored. For more, see below.

    #### Debugging:

    - #### Warning: Article/Section lacks heading. Consider using `h2`-`h6` elements to [add identifying headings to all sections](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Usage/Headings/Missing).

        - Solution: Where necessary, I added a heading or replaced `<section>` with `<div>` in order to avoid this warning. In other cases, (i.e. the News/Events page and the signup form on the Contacts page), I believe I used `<article>` and `<section>` correctly as semantic elements to contain and describe distinct areas of a page, even though I felt a heading element was not warranted, and used `<div>` to handle block-level layout and structure otherwise. I therefore ignored the warning in those cases since it is a non-normative usage recommendation, as per the [HTML5 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/PR-html5-20140916/sections.html#the-section-element).
    
    - #### Error: Attribute `controlslist` not allowed on element [audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-audio-element) at this point.

        - Solution: Ignored. The `controlslist` attribute was used with the value `nodownload` to remove the download option from the menu on `<audio>` elements. The error is reported by the W3C validator because, although it works, this attribute is not included in the official HTML5 standard for the [audio](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-audio-element) element "at this point" in time.

    - #### Error: Text not allowed in element [iframe](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-iframe-element) in this context.

        - Solution: When embedding YouTube and facebook videos, I mistakenly added fallback text and alternate links between the opening and closing tags, as is done with the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements, forgetting that such content is not permitted in the `<iframe>` element. I simply removed the content.

    #### Results:

### Further Testing

- The website was tested in various browsers: Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; Microsoft Edge; Safari.

- The website was tested for responsive design, appearance and functionality on all standard screen sizes using the Chrome devtools device toolbar. It was also tested on various physical devices such as: low and high resolution desktop and laptop displays; various Android tablets and iPads; Samsung Galaxy S6, S8, S9 and A52 5G; iPhone 8, 11 and 12 Mini.

- A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly and that no external links were broken.

- Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. One family member with impaired vision was asked to confirm that the header, navigation links and content were readable and understandable.

### Bugs

#### Fixed Bug

- #### Header navigation menu: sizing issue

    I noticed a sizing problem with the header on smaller screens, especially in landscape mode, when I first started to style it for responsive design. It encroached too far down onto the hero image, obscuring it, even after downsizing, but if I made the navigation menu any smaller it became difficult to see. I also wanted to avoid reducing the size of the band logo at all, if possible.

    I realised that I could solve the issue by switching the original, inline-styled navigation menu for a 'hamburger' style drop-down menu on medium to small screen sizes. I achieved this by first wrapping the original #main-menu list in a div with an id of "main-menu-inline". I then created the drop-down menu inside the same `<nav>` element in HTML by using the `<details>` element with a Font Awesome 'hamburger' icon in the `<summary>` tag, and copied the original navigation menu list into the disclosure widget. I gave it an id of "main-menu-dropdown", styled it to look like a standard drop-down menu and set the media queries to switch between the two menu styles at 800 pixels using the property `display: none;`. The media queries can be seen below.
```css
    @media screen and (min-width: 801px) {
        #main-menu-dropdown {
            display: none;
        }
    }
    @media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
        #main-menu-inline {
            display: none;
        }
    }
```
#### Unfixed Bug

- #### Default `<summary>` element marker showing in Safari

    When testing the website in different browsers, I noticed that the triangular, default marker on all `<summary>` elements was still showing up in Safari alone, despite the CSS property `list-style-type: none;` being applied. According to various searches, this is apparently because `list-style-type` isn't supported on the `<summary>` element in webkit-based browsers, although it seems to work on `<ul>` and `<li>` elements.

    My search for a solution yielded some suggestions: on Stack Overflow, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66814239); on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/Fyrd/caniuse/issues/5869); and a 3rd on Stack Overflow, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70834941). These led me to try out the following code to no avail.

```css
    summary::marker {
    display: none;
  }
```
or
```css
    summary::marker {
    content: none;
  }
```
or
```css
    summary::marker {
    content: "";
  }
```
and finally
```css
summary::marker {
    display: none;
    content: none;
  }
```
